    <p class="paragraph">My name is Kaitlyn Cross. I am a senior this year at Eastern Washington University, looking to (finally) get my degree in Visual Communication Design.
      <br>When I am not designing for the web you can find me either working one of my two jobs, or catching some ZZZZZ's.
      <br>My hobbies include eating sugary snacks, doodling, petting dogs, watching cartoons, reading comics, switching back and forth between the same 3 apps for several hours, and laughing at cheesy puns.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-7">This was just a part of a project I did in Digital Foundations about London. I am a huge fan of Emma Watson both as a nerd and as a Feminist and this is a Digital Portrait I did of her.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-2">I made this "Sticker" in VCD I. I was told to make something absurd and I couldn't get out of my head "Pizza is Life", because I had to work at Pizza Hut that night. So in a way it is like a self portrait.</p>

          <h4 class="heading-5">Rhino Mechanical</h4><img class="image-4" src="images/Rhino-Logo.svg">
          <p class="paragraph-8">I recently got the chance to work on a logo for a local heating and duct company called "Rhino Mechanical". I worked with a partner on this project. (Meagan Cunningham-Strope) and it was a mix of both of our designs that ultimately was chosen. I really valued the collaboration, she had won an "Addie" when she went through the design program.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-9">I took a class called "Publication Design" and in this class I was asked to do a total re-branding of an existing company with a team of two other people. I was in charge of the deliverables, including logo, business card, envelopes and letterhead. I am happy about what I did with the logo as well as the business card. This is the logo and/or back of the business card.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-10">This is the front of the business card. I was told by the guy who built the website with me that she still uses this business card but I am not so sure. I like that aspect of the card, besides that I did this my very first year in the design program so there are definitely things I wish I could tweak about it.</p>
